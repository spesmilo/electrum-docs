Electrum protocol specification
===============================

(NOTE: this document is outdated. For newer versions of the protocol than 0.10, see https://electrumx-spesmilo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol.html )

Stratum is a universal bitcoin communication protocol used
mainly by bitcoin client Electrum and miners.


Format
------

Stratum protocol is based on `JSON-RPC 2.0`_ (although it doesn't
include "jsonrpc" information in every message). Each
message has to end with a line end character (\n).

.. _JSON-RPC 2.0: http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification

Request
```````

Typical request looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 0, "method":"some.stratum.method", "params": [] }

- id begins at 0 and every message has its unique id number
- list and description of possible methods is below
- params is an array, e.g.: [ "1myfirstaddress", "1mysecondaddress", "1andonemoreaddress" ]

Response
````````
Responses are similar:

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 0, "result": "616be06545e5dd7daec52338858b6674d29ee6234ff1d50120f060f79630543c"}

- id is copied from the request message (this way client can pair each
  response to one of his requests)
- result can be:

  - null
  - a string (as shown above)
  - a hash, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: json

       { "nonce": 1122273605, "timestamp": 1407651121, "version": 2, "bits": 406305378 }

  - an array of hashes, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: json

       [ { "tx_hash:
       "b87bc42725143f37558a0b41a664786d9e991ba89d43a53844ed7b3752545d4f",
       "height": 314847 }, { "tx_hash":
       "616be06545e5dd7daec52338858b6674d29ee6234ff1d50120f060f79630543c",
       "height": 314853 } ]

Methods
-------

server.version
``````````````

This is usually the first client's message, plus it's sent every
minute as a keep-alive message. Client sends its own version and
version of the protocol it supports. Server responds with its
supported version of the protocol (higher number at server-side is
usually compatible).

The version of the protocol being explained in this documentation
is: 0.10.

*request:*

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 0, "method": "server.version", "params": [ "1.9.5", "0.6" ] }

*response:*

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 0, "result": "0.8" }

server.banner
`````````````
*request:*

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 1, "method": "server.banner", "params": [] }

server.donation_address
```````````````````````

server.peers.subscribe
``````````````````````

Client can this way ask for a list of other active
servers. Servers are connected to an IRC channel (#electrum
at freenode.net) where they can see each other. Each server
announces its version, history pruning limit of every
address ("p100", "p10000" etc.–the number means how many
transactions the server may keep for every single address)
and supported protocols ("t" = tcp@50001, "h" = http@8081,
"s" = tcp/tls@50002, "g" = https@8082; non-standard port
would be announced this way: "t3300" for tcp on port 3300).


**Note:** At the time of writing there isn't a true
subscription implementation of this method, but servers
only send one-time response. They don't send notifications
yet.

*request:*

.. code-block:: json

   { "id": 3, "method":
   "server.peers.subscribe", "params": [] }<br/>

*response:*

.. code-block:: json

   "electrum.stepkrav.pw", [ "v0.9", "p100", "t", "h", "s",
   "g" ] ], [ "23.94.27.149", "ultra-feather.net", [ "v0.9",
   "p10000", "t", "h", "s", "g" ] ], [ "88.198.241.196",
   "electrum.be", [ "v0.9", "p10000", "t", "h", "s", "g" ] ] ]
   }

blockchain.numblocks.subscribe
